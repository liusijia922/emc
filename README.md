# Effective Mass Calculation

This script computes the effective mass of electrons by fitting their band structure data with polynomial and curve fitting methods, and visualizes the results. It converts wave vector data to inverse Bohr radii and energy data to Hartrees, applying `numpy.polyfit` and `scipy.optimize.curve_fit` to estimate and compare effective masses, making it a valuable tool for semiconductor physics analysis.
